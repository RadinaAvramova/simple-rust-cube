## Simple Rust Cube App
Welcome to the Simple Rust Cube App! This application is a basic implementation of a cube rendering using the Rust programming language and the OpenGL graphics library.

## Overview
The Simple Rust Cube App demonstrates how to create a simple 3D cube and render it on the screen using Rust and OpenGL. It serves as a beginner-friendly example for those interested in learning graphics programming with Rust.

## Features
1. **3D Cube Rendering:** Display a rotating 3D cube on the screen using OpenGL.

2. **Basic Controls:** Rotate the cube using keyboard controls to observe it from different angles.

3. **Simple Interface:** The app provides a minimalistic interface, making it easy to understand the basics of graphics programming in Rust.

## Installation
To run the Simple Rust Cube App:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/RadinaAvramova/simple-rust-cube.git
2. **Navigate to the Directory:** Change your current directory to the location of the cloned repository:
cd simple-rust-cube
3. **Build and Run:** Build and run the application using Cargo, Rust's package manager:
cargo run
4. **Enjoy:** Once the application is running, you should see a window displaying a rotating cube. Use the arrow keys to rotate the cube and observe it from different angles.

## Dependencies
The Simple Rust Cube App depends on the following libraries:

- **OpenGL:** The OpenGL graphics library for rendering 3D graphics.
- **glutin:** A library for creating OpenGL contexts and handling events.
- **gl:** A Rust OpenGL function loader.
  
These dependencies are managed automatically by Cargo, Rust's package manager, and will be installed when you build the project.

## Compatibility
The Simple Rust Cube App is compatible with most systems that support OpenGL and Rust. Ensure that you have the necessary graphics drivers installed for optimal performance.
